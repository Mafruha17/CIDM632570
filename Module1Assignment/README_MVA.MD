## üß™ MiniLab ‚Äì MVP Logistics Platform: AI-Enhanced Perishable Food Delivery

This README outlines the scope, design, setup, and delivery goals for the Minimum Viable Artifact (MVA) of the AI-enhanced perishable food logistics platform. This MVP is structured to be delivered and deployed within a 1‚Äì2 week window and will serve as the first tangible deliverable for the CIDM 6325/70 course project.

## üéØ Objective
To demonstrate a prototype of an AI-assisted logistics system that:
- Accepts perishable shipment orders
- Uses a simulated AI engine to generate delivery routes and ETAs
- Visualizes real-time updates for dispatchers and client endpoints

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technology Stack
| Layer        | Tech Used               |
|--------------|-------------------------|
| Front-End    | Bootstrap 5 + HTMX      |
| Back-End     | Django (views, models)  |
| AI Logic     | Python module (mock logic or simple sklearn rule) |
| Database     | SQLite (mock delivery & order data) |
| Deployment   | Localhost (dev server) / Optional: Heroku |

## üîß Feature Scope (MVP)
| Feature                     | Description                                                                 |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Order Entry UI**          | Form to enter destination, product type, delivery urgency                   |
| **Mock AI Route Planner**   | Simulates best route based on origin/destination matrix                     |
| **ETA Simulation**          | Simulates countdown / updates to user-facing dashboard                      |
| **Warehouse Dashboard**     | Tracks pending shipments, routes, status updates                            |
| **Client Notifications**    | Endpoint-facing view of expected delivery time                              |
| **Audit Log (Optional)**    | Displays how AI made decisions (transparency for MVA phase)                 |

## üë• Actors
- **Warehouse Staff** ‚Äì Places order, sees routes
- **AI System (Mocked)** ‚Äì Assigns best-fit route and ETA
- **Driver (Simulated)** ‚Äì Progress visible through dashboard
- **Client** ‚Äì Checks delivery status via read-only interface

## üß± Core Data Models
| Model       | Fields                                                             |
|-------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Order`     | `id`, `product_type`, `destination`, `timestamp`, `urgency`       |
| `Route`     | `id`, `origin`, `destination`, `eta_minutes`                      |
| `Delivery`  | `order_id`, `driver_name`, `status`, `ai_rationale`              |
