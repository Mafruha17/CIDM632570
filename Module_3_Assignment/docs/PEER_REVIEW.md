##  Part D: Peer Review – External Assessment

**Reviewed Repository:** [Teammate’s Repo Name or GitHub Link]  
**Reviewer:** Mafruha Chowdhury  
**Course:** CIDM 6325 – Electronic Commerce (Fall 2025)

###  1. Overview

This peer review provides an external critique of [teammate name]'s repository developed as part of the Module 3 assignment. The project implements a Django-based web application focused on delivery orders and customer management, incorporating form validation, model relationships, and administrative interfaces. This assessment evaluates the codebase for clarity, design alignment, and business fit.

### 2. Strengths

**Clear Model Design**  
The structure of `models.py` demonstrates a solid understanding of relational design. The use of a `Customer` model with a `ForeignKey` relationship to `Order` is both scalable and semantically appropriate.

**Effective Validation**  
The forms enforce basic business rules effectively. For example, validations that restrict past-dated orders and client-location mismatches are clearly implemented and improve data integrity.

**Accessible UI**  
The use of Bootstrap styling and screen reader-friendly tags suggests awareness of UX and accessibility best practices.

**Good Use of Admin Interface**  
The admin dashboard appears to be configured with `list_display` and search filters that enhance usability. CRUD testing through admin is confirmed.

**Clean Codebase**  
Directory structure is clean, templates are logically named, and function naming is consistent. Code comments help reinforce understanding of form logic.

### 3. Suggestions for Improvement

**Missing Frontend Error Feedback (HTMX)**  
Though the HTMX compatibility was mentioned, live feedback on form validation could be further improved with inline updates instead of redirect-based error display.

**No ETA or AI Logic Visible**  
While some teams implemented mock AI logic (e.g., ETA calculation), this repo may benefit from a simple function—even hardcoded—to simulate real-world data transformation.

**Testing Strategy**  
There’s no sign of unit or manual testing documentation. A short checklist or `tests.py` with basic form/model tests would improve confidence in long-term extensibility.

**README Expansion**  
The current README covers setup instructions but could use more context about business assumptions and model relationships. Embedding a visual schema (ERD) would make the architecture clearer for new readers.

###  4. Overall Impression

This project is thoughtfully implemented and aligns well with the module’s learning objectives. The models reflect a practical logistics workflow, and the form validation demonstrates a real-world awareness of business rules. With a few enhancements—especially around frontend interaction and documentation—the repo would be ready for external deployment or stakeholder demo.
